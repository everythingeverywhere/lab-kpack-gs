[`kpack`](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack) is a Kubernetes-native build service that builds container images on Kubernetes using [Cloud Native Buildpacks](../cnb-what-is). It takes source code repositories (like GitHub), builds the code into a container image, and uploads it to the container registry of your choice.
